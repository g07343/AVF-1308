				<strong>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Instagram be used in these two scenarios?</strong><br><br>
				 

				Using live data allows us as developers to greatly enhance the way a user interacts with our software.  Using Instagram for instance, we could allow the user to use live data in the form of any other possible login credentials they may possess such as Facebook or an email account such as Gmail.  Allowing them to use these takes the burden of needing to memorize yet another set of username/password combos, and also allows us as developers to authenticate that they are in fact who they claim to be.  Taking this a bit farther would be using live data in regards to making payments.  A few examples would be the obvious Paypal, or even some of the mobile versions coming into common use, such as Google Wallet.  These can be incorporated into an Instagram app to allow the user to securely make a payment if necessary, as it requires the user to authenticate with Paypal and use the live data the API would then return.<br><br>

				 

				<strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong><br><br>

				 

				We must use JSON-P specifically in order to make cross-domain requests, as generally these are not allowed.  It also allows us to be able to do something with any data returned from the server, instead of simply viewing it.  In this way we can provide live data to the user that they can actually interact with.<br><br>

				 

				 <strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong><br><br>

				Looking over the search results, it's very quickly apparent that many native device features will have a lot to do with what kind of data will be returned.  In Instagram's case, perhaps the device's camera will be utilized.  For a music identifying app, the device's microphone and speakers would be needed.  Likewise any sort of navigation software would require the use of the device's GPS to determine the user's location.<br><br>

				 

				<strong>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</strong><br><br>

				 

				My app in regards to functionality is simple.  It allows a user to immediately take pictures from the very first screen, and then have them automatically uploaded to either Instagram or Flickr (or both).  This will require the use of the devices camera as well as possibly storage.  The user will also need to go into a settings screen to authenticate their account with Instagram/Flickr.  There will also be a "view" page, which will allow the user to either browse the pictures they've taken, or perform a search on the aforementioned photo sites.<br><br>

				 

				<strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong><br><br>

				In the past, I would oftentimes not leave myself enough time to truly grasp the material before a project was due.  This would often result in me implementing the requirements for that particular project in a way that wasn't as I originally intended.  Having learned this lesson, I have been studying much sooner and planning out my app in regards to how the different "pieces" will fit together and be laid out.  Having this over arching plan in my head gives me a better idea of how to proceed when it comes time to actually start building my app, and keeps me (mostly) organized throughout the process.<br><br>

				 

				I have also learned not to immediately focus on the details while actually developing an app.  I would often spend hours trying to perfect a certain aspect of a part of my entire project, when I may not have necessarily had the time to do so.  This would lead me to having to work extra hard to complete the rest of the app in time and result in a particularly polished portion of the app, next to another part that maybe was rushed in order for it to be finished in time.  I now get the basic functionality and layout completed before going back in to modify the smaller details.</p>
